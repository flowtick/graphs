# Algorithms

graphs allows to extend the Graph interface so that you can execute some common operations and algorithms on it.

Currently the following algorithms are supported:

* Depth-first traversal
* Breadth-first traversal
* Topological sorting using a depth-first approach
* Dijkstras algorithm for shortest paths

## Topological sorting example

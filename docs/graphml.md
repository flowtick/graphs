## GraphML support

`graphs` supports rendering and loading (currently only on the JVM) of graphs to GraphML XML:

@@snip [SimpleGraphApp.scala](../examples/src/main/scala/GraphMLRendererApp.scala)

This format is used by the [yed editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed), so graphs can be edited and 
layouted there.
